# Enigmazing

## Introduction
Enigmazing is a small, simple encryption app built in Java that was inspired by the movie The Imitation Game. It uses a simple Affine Cipher to encrypt or decrypt provided text or .txt files by applying tranformations to each character based on its index within a scrambled alphabet of 94 characters (including punctuation, etc). The Affine Cipher operates based on two keys, a multiplier and a shift factor.

The app has two modes: normal and embedded key mode. In embedded key mode, the encryption keys would be embedded in the cipher text, allowing anyone who had this app to decrypt it.

You can download the app [here](https://github.com/WriterZephos/Enigmazing/raw/master/Enigmazing.jar) (Java executable).
